# Coding Challenging Quiz
Created by Siddharth Desai

## Description
The reason behind this coding quiz, is to help people learn more about global geography. There is a robust list of questions to really help someone get a good grasp of geography. Upon clicking the start quiz the timer will start as the user navigates through the questions. When the user clicks the start button the quiz will begin. The time will keep decrementing as the quiz is in play. Upong a wrong answer the time will decrement by order of magnitude more. When the user selects an answer the background will change to red for wrong and answer and green for correct answer. As well, as the "wrong" and "correct" text display. If the timer reaches 0 or if the user answers all the questions the timer will stop and be stored in local storage. The page will then display all the incorrect questions answered with there correct answer. The score will display at the top which is equal to the timer value at the end of the quiz. Also, a input will display requesting the user to input their initials. Upon the submit button the page will display all the scores from the quiz with the top score displayed in green and the lowest score displayed in red.

This project improved my knowledge and understanding of Javascript and how to manipulate the HTML and CSS via different triggers and processes in Javascript. I feel very confident in my javascript skills after completing this project. Some areas I would like to improve on is CSS and thinking more creatively on how to display content.
